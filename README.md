# SD2 Tower Defense

Defend your castle from the closing in enemies! Build towers to shoot 'em down.

## Controls

Press left-click to place a tower on a viable spot. A tower costs $50. You can remove a tower by clicking it again, to get a percentage of the building costs back.

## Mechanics

### Smooth grid selection

Hover over the map to easily see where you can - and can't - build towers.

### UI

* Look at the top-left of your screen to see how many enemies are currently alive, and how many will spawn during this wave.
* The bar at the top-right displays how much health your castle has left
* The numbers on the bottom-left display how much currency you have left

### Enemies

Enemies will follow the path corner to corner to get to your castle and try to bring it down. They will walk into your castle and do one-time damage before evaporating. Enemies will be shot by towers, and display their remaining health above their heads.

### Towers

A tower can be placed on any valid tile using left-click, after which a certain amount of currency will be deducted from your balance. Towers will shoot a laser at the closest enemy within their range. They can not shoot through other objects, like trees, so strategic placement is key.
You can remove a tower by left-clicking it again, to get a percentage of the building costs back.
